For pertaining, the suffix number do not corresponds to the fold but rather a batch of tickers considered. The batches are sorted by train tickers as follows

1. Tickers from 0 to 299
2. Tickers from 300 to 499
3. Tickers from 500 to 700

Model weights from the previous batch is used to the current batch.

Becasue of limited memory, I had to take this step.
